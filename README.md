# Stack app

## Start the project

To start the project you should run ```react-native run-ios``` or ```react-native run-android```
inside Stack app project folder

## Creds

To login you should use following creds ```login: admin``` ```password: pass```

## Android version

To test Android version of the app you should use real android device instead of emulator, to do so you should follow the [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device#1-enable-debugging-over-usb).

The reason is that if using Android Emulator you should setup SSL certificate.
